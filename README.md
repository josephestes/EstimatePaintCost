# EstimatePaintCost

This program estimates the cost of painting a room.

### Program Logic

- Prompt the user for length and width of a room in feet within the Main() method
- Accept the values and comput the cost of painting the room using a separate method
- Assuming that:
  1. The rooms are rectangular and have four foot walls and nine foot ceilings
  2. The area of one wall will be length of the wall times the height of the wall
  3. The price of the job is $6 per square foot
