# EstimatePaintCost

This program estimates the cost of painting a room.

## Usage/Examples

```
Please enter the room length in feet:
10
Enter the room width in feet:
11
The cost of painting this room is: $3588

Press any key to close this window . . .
```

### Program Logic

- Prompt the user for length and width of a room in feet within the Main() method
- Accept the values and comput the cost of painting the room using a separate method
- Assume that:
  1. The rooms are rectangular and have four foot walls and nine foot ceilings
  2. The area of one wall will be length of the wall times the height of the wall
  3. The price of the job is $6 per square foot
